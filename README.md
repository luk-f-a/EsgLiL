# Introduction

EsgLiL is acollection of tools and models for generating scenarios for use in life insurance modelling.

# Motivation

Scenario generators are mostly propietary. Those open-source, like QuantLib, require non-trivial installation and require some time to understand its class model. The objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface, similar to sklearn, constructing models as pipelines.

# Installation

You can download EsgLiL stand-alone from gitlab or as part of its parent project, PyLiL. We recommend that you create virtual environment (with conda or virtualenv) and install all the packages in the requirements.txt. 
NN-LiL has been tested with Python 3.6 and all the versions described in the requirements.txt file. After creating an environment with Pyhon 3.6, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to quickly install all those dependencies.
